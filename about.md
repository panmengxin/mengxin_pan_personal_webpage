My name is Mengxin Pan. In Jan 2025, I will join the Department of Geography at Simon Fraser University as a tenure-track assistant professor and build up the ”Climate and Weather Extremes Lab”. I am seeking Master’s and Ph.D. students to join my group in Fall 2025 or Spring/Fall 2026. Both Master’s and PhD students have comprehensive funding support, covering tuition and living expenses in Vancouver, Canada.
